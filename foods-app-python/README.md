Foods application

My app uses SQL and tkinter

You can run my app with 
python3 mainwfront.py
This launches the front end cleaner version of the app but it does have a few bugs I could not figure out how to fix.

python3 main.py
This command launches the clp version of the app and all of the functionality in this version works perfectly and communicates very smoothly with 
my SQL data bases

There shouldn't be any downloads when getting the app up and running. 

While creating this application I ran into many problems when trying to convert it to tkinter so I used code copilot to assist me with the front end
and creation of the final product.

I used many stackoverflow searches

I also used this guide to tkinter

Description

The foods app is a one stop shop for all your recipe and grocery needs!
This application keeps track of every ingredient you’ve ever needed
From the ones in your pantry to the ones in your freezer the foods app helps you keep inventory of everything you have in your house
Even of the ingredients you once had but don’t any more!
It also keeps track of all your favorite recipes!
It makes it easy for you to look them up however you want, if you want to just browse what sounds good from A-Z or if you’re in a rush and need a quick meal under 15 minutes or maybe have some more time for  a dinner 16-45 minutes in cooking time
Or maybe you’re just interested in what you can make based on the inventory you have at home?
Then when you need help making your grocery list it is right there for you to add to and check on
Your grocery list can then be easily crafted based on the inventory you have at your house so you make sure not to double up on anything
When you’re checking your recipes you can even check for ones you have most of the ingredients of that way when you’re at the store you know that you only need to buy buns for the burgers sitting in the fridge
Maybe you’re a college student like me and you’re trying not to eat junk food for every meal (even though it’s so cheapppp)
This app can even help you create a meal plan for the week and tell you all the nutrients you’d get so you make sure you’re staying healthy
The optimization of the kitchen is endless with the Foods App!
